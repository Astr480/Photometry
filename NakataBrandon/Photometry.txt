Photometry and Data Reduction Questions

(2 pt) QUESTION: Define the bias. Include both a description of what it looks like
physically, why it occurs, and how we take it into account (how do we remove its effect
on our data images?)
---Bias is a image that is taken with no exposure time. It is supposed to be fully black
but will usually have spots that are not. We take this image and subtract it form the images
we gather in order to account for how the pixels vary between each other. 



(1 pt) QUESTION: Why would we use more than one bias frame? 
---We take more than one bias frame and take the median so that we can subtract all artifacts from
the image we want. This is so that we can reduce the noise given off by the bias frame.

(1 pt) QUESTION: List the average value of each of your bias frames, as well as your final
master bias. 
---Bias file averages:
351.70354319927594
351.3568139518693
351.65315007774245
351.7383458262746
351.675116381611
351.7116537095913
351.40129446984287
351.67762200923625
351.6943257292706
351.5752312547864
351.4999043883874

Master Bias Average:
351.4886535471444 

(1 pt) QUESTION: Define “overscan”.
---Overscan is where the computer tries to read data from part of the detector that does not exist. Since there is no detector, there will
be no light that is read and as such will produce black lines on the edge of the image.

(1 pt) QUESTION: List your overscan parameters here.
From 1023 to 1077 on the x-axis is overscan. Additionally, from 1023 to 1027 in the
y-axis there is also an overscan area.

(1 pt) QUESTION: Which filters do you have flat fields for? List the flat field file names for
each filter.
I have flats for both the Wash M and J-C Rc filters
Wash M filter: Flat.0005 to Flat.0016
J-C Rc: Flat.0016 to Flat.0041


(1 pt) QUESTION: Why do we need flat fields for each filter we have used for
observations?
We use flat fields for each filter because each filter will be unique in the way it changes the light. For example, if one filter
happens to have dust while another does not, we will need a flat in order to compensate for the dust seen. Since there
 are multiple filters that will be used, we will need a flat for each one.

(1 pt) QUESTION: What drawbacks could exist from this method of sky subtraction?


(1 pt) QUESTION: Why does sky subtraction matter?



(1 PT) Question: How many objects did you identify with DAOStarFinder? Look at your
image. Do you think that’s a reasonable number? What did you change to adjust the
number of stars detected? How many stars did you end up with?
With DAO, I detected 212 stars. From the image this seems pretty reasonable. Most of
the objects the star finder picked up tended to be at stars. I adjusted the two main
parameters (threshold and fwhm)

(1 pt) QUESTION: Are you happy with your apertures? Why or why not? Save the list of
sources for comparison. Why did you choose the method (center, exact, subpixel) to
solve the square pixel/round aperture problem?
I am decently happy with my apertures. They seem to be fairly accurate and tend to cover
most of the stars in the image.

Pick your object aperture and write it here: CircularAnnulus
Pick your sky annulus minimum and maximum and write it here: 3 (min) and 10 (max)


(1 pt) QUESTION: Make a plot comparing the measurements of the two different
methods.


(1 pt) QUESTION: Make a plot comparing the PSF fitting output to the aperture output.
Are they the same? Why or why not?


(3 pt) QUESTION: Summarize your experience with this lab. What was your main take
away? What was particularly challenging?
---The main takeaways from this lab was using bias and flats. I had a pretty rough
understanding of both bias and flat. However, having to use each of the images in
a more hands on way, made my understanding of both bias and flat much easier. It was also
helpful to work with the photometry part of the lab. I found it to be much harder than the
data reduction. The challenge in the photometry was mainly the code. There was a lot of
objects and classes that I needed to work with that was completely new to me. Because of this,
I had a much harder time working with photometry. Especially with the PSF.

(2 pt) QUESTION: Did you prefer PSF fitting or aperture photometry? Think of one
situation that you think would be best for each method.
---I personally liked aperture photometry more than PSF fitting. It was much easier to see where
we got the numbers from than in PSF.
